Recently, I have been attempting to improve my programming skills through solving codewars challenges. To this repository I've added some of the more complex/fun solutions I have come across. Below is a little bit of information about codewars, and in each file you can read the problems to be solved followed by my solutions!

## Ranks

Ranks are used to indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of Kata. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan, which are divided in 8 levels each. By increasing order of proficiency/difficulty:

- 8 Kyu to 1 Kyu
- 1 Dan to 8 Dan

Why the names Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu (or KyÅ«) indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward. Black belts in martial arts are Dan level.

## Kata Ranks

These are codewars' definitions of how a kata rank represents programming level.

### 8 Kyu - 6 Kyu

I haven't added these solutions in. They are generally easier and there are too many to add.

### 5 Kyu

5 kyu kata represent a novice programming level. At this level, the kata are similar to 6 kyu but more challenging. It includes:

- Complex language features that require mature OOP/Functional concepts
- Advanced OOP/Functional concepts
- Complex Design Patterns
- Advanced regular expression usage

### 4 Kyu

4 kyu kata represent a competent programming level. At this level, the kata begin to take some serious thought to complete. They include tasks that may handle:

- Computer science concepts utilizing complex algorithms
- Advanced design patterns
- Understanding intricate business requirements
- Advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism, meta programming and cryptography

### 3 Kyu

3 kyu kata represent a competent programming level. At this level, the kata are similar to 4 kyu but are more challenging. They include tasks that may handle:

- Computer science concepts utilizing advanced algorithms
- Ability to implement advanced requirements in a scalable fashion
- Basic AI/machine learning algorithms
- Detailed usage of advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism and cryptography
